The client DriverPass requested a system that would allow for users to create accounts, sign up for appointments, and complete online classes to fulfill a market gap in the new driver market. I feel that my work on the business requirements document is the best out of my other documents. The document contains short but precise answers to all the pertinent questions and would be a helpful document in the development process. One document that I would like to revise would be the diagrams I completed documenting the different use cases within the software. For my revisions, I would prefer to go into more detail and highlight more precise details of the system. With these revisions, it would make the development of the program more seamless. I interpreted the user’s needs from examining provided documentation and thinking through what I would like to see if I was using the program. Considering the user’s needs within the design is critical for the software’s overall success. A program without any of the requirements or functionality that the user needs will result in a program without any users. My approach when designing software is to identify the main objectives of the program and ensure they are included in the design documents. Additionally, I think through the user’s perspective and implement items that would make their experience easier.
